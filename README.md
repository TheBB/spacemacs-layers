# spacemacs-layers
Miscellaneous layers for Spacemacs

## Installation
To install these layers, clone this repository into your `.emacs.d/private`
directory. Then add the layers you want to enable to
`dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` in your dotfile.

For this to work, you need the latest development version of Spacemacs.
